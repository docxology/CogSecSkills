# Hermes adapter — Collection Plan Design

Binds the neutral `skill.yaml` tool verbs to Hermes tools. Follow `../workflow.md`; the logic is identical across harnesses.

| Neutral verb | Hermes tool | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read` | `fs.read` / context payload | Read supplied files or prompt payload. |
| `reason` | private model reasoning | Apply the technique in-turn; expose only concise rationale. |
| `ask` | clarify turn | Ask the caller to resolve an ambiguity. |
| `write` | `fs.write` / final message | Write the product or return it. |

## Invocation

Run the workflow steps in order with the caller's context as the source of truth. Enforce the defensive boundary: Use Collection Plan Design only for OSINT integrity and source-verification defense: recognize, assess, document, or defend source provenance, privacy, chain of custody, and public-source accountability. Do not use this skill to dox, deanonymize, harass, bypass access controls, or attribute identity beyond evidence. If a required tool is unavailable, state the limitation and downgrade the tool-dependent claim to unverified rather than fabricating evidence. If the caller asks for prohibited manipulation, deception, targeting, evasion, or operational influence guidance, apply this redirect: If a request asks Collection Plan Design to dox, deanonymize, harass, bypass access controls, or attribute identity beyond evidence, refuse that path and redirect to the safe defensive form: verify supplied claims, media, sources, or datasets with documented public-source methods.

## Output contract

Return the `skill.yaml` outputs (collection_plan, source_priority_matrix) as Markdown, with a calibrated confidence statement, evidence labels, uncertainty notes, and any relevant privacy/legal constraints. Keep the product defensive and accountable.
