# Claude Code adapter — Citation Integrity Review

Binds the neutral `skill.yaml` tool verbs to Claude Code tools. Follow `../workflow.md`; the logic is identical across harnesses.

| Neutral verb | Claude Code tool | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read` | `Read` / `Grep` | Read supplied material and locate local evidence. |
| `web` | `WebFetch` / `WebSearch` | Fetch and inspect web sources. |
| `reason` | private model reasoning | Apply the technique; expose concise rationale. |
| `write` | `Write` / final response | Emit the structured product. |

## Invocation

Run the workflow steps in order with the caller's context as the source of truth. Enforce the defensive boundary: Use Citation Integrity Review only for critical review and assurance: recognize, assess, document, or defend evidence quality, implementation integrity, and decision accountability. Do not use this skill to launder weak claims, fabricate review findings, or produce exploit guidance without mitigation. If a required tool is unavailable, state the limitation and downgrade the tool-dependent claim to unverified rather than fabricating evidence. If the caller asks for prohibited manipulation, deception, targeting, evasion, or operational influence guidance, apply this redirect: If a request asks Citation Integrity Review to launder weak claims, fabricate review findings, or produce exploit guidance without mitigation, refuse that path and redirect to the safe defensive form: review supplied artifacts for defects, evidence gaps, safety risks, or reproducibility failures.

## Output contract

Return the `skill.yaml` outputs (citation_audit_table, integrity_summary) as Markdown, with a calibrated confidence statement, evidence labels, uncertainty notes, and any relevant privacy/legal constraints. Keep the product defensive and accountable.
