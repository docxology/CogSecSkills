# Codex adapter — Cognitive Bias Audit

Binds the neutral `skill.yaml` tool verbs to Codex tools. Follow `../workflow.md`; the logic is identical across harnesses.

| Neutral verb | Codex tool | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read` | `shell` (`cat`, `rg`) | Read supplied files or stdin. |
| `reason` | private model reasoning | Apply the technique with concise rationale. |
| `write` | `apply_patch` / stdout | Persist the product or return Markdown. |

## Invocation

Run the workflow steps in order with the caller's context as the source of truth. If a required tool is unavailable, state the limitation and downgrade the tool-dependent claim to unverified rather than fabricating evidence.

## Output contract

Return the `skill.yaml` outputs (bias_audit_report, priority_bias_summary) as Markdown, with a calibrated confidence statement. Keep the product defensive and accountable.
